# Notes

These are some simple playbooks to get a vagrant to work with some basic stuff installed.
Put the bootstrap script into vagrantfile to get it to setup enough of the VM to use ansible.





# COMMANDS

## run a playbook
ansible-playbook playbook.yml

## run a play in a playbook localhost
ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local helloworld.yml

## adhoc
ansible all -m shell -a 'echo hello worldâ€™

## ansible galaxy

ansible-galaxy install username.rolename

Roles default to /etc/ansible
I think you can add them to your role using the include directive after that.



# GOTCHAS

## space after colon
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/YAMLSyntax.html#gotchas


## yaml need spaces
This gives you a ton of syntax errors.
